## What is ChewSnap?

#### Idea

ChewSnap is an application based on two components: food and social media. It allows users to keep track of day to day meals whether it be a comfortable meal from home or an extravagant one during vacation. Once done recording meals, users can share those meals with their friends as well as browse any incoming meals sent to the user.

#### Part 1: The App

This app was built using Android Studio for the front-end UI design. It includes a simple login-signup activity as well as multiple fragments for the main activity including: your list of meals, create a meal, and meal inbox.

#### Part 2: The Server

The server side of this app is built using Python flask server. It utilizes shared-file system for storage of images and sqlite3 library of python for database storage of user and meal information.

### Quick Start For Developers

This application is still in the building process. I encourage any developers who want to contribute to fork the repository and pull request to main branch.
